# DataManagementAndVisualisationProject
This project is focusing on analyzing the FitBit data, we created an accessible and interactive BI based on Fitbit's data.   

Especially, we analyzed the user's action and listed the Active Minutes by Category, Hours Asleep by Category.  

After that, we specifically focused on Hourly Steps, Average Calories and Distance by Weekday and made one page for analyzing the insights.  

Same for Sleeping Time, so that we can personalize words to inform user to be healthy.  

The key is all of these are interactive, which is pretty cool and practical.
